    <h1>'Street Runner'</h1>
    <h2>Rod Wave</h2>
    
    <p>[Intro]
        (Pipe that shit up, TnT) <br>
        These mixed signals, mixed signals, they're killing me <br>
        I don't know what you want, but I know what I need <br>
        The 'goodbyes', the 'hellos', the 'I need you' 'no I don't' <br>
        Every time I start to close the door, you knock and I let you in <br>
        Loving you is my greatest sin <br>
        Loving you is my greatest sin <br>
        Loving you is my greatest sin <br>
        Youngin' <br>
        Look, uh <br>
        <br>
        [Verse]
        Sorry I missed your call, I was on a jet <br>
        I been so zoned out, tryna figure out what's next <br>
        So scared to fail, I'm calculatin' my every step <br>
        Gotta watch my back and keep my strap, but nonetheless <br>
        I think about you when I'm gone (Yeah), wishing I could hold you <br>
        Probably home, wishin' someone come and love you how they 'posed to <br>
        And I hope you see this letter 'fore it's too late (Yeah) <br>
        I hope chasin' my dreams don't get in the way <br>
        I blame my struggles and my uncles for my hustlin' ways <br>
        I'm way in Michigan right now, lookin' at real estate <br>
        Lord knows I wanna lay ya down but I'm chasin' cake <br>
        Can't go back broke, stay on the go, that's all that's on my brain <br>
        <br>
        
        
        
        [Bridge]
        She tell me fuck you, I hate you, then I love you, can't blame you <br>
        She say I love you, but don't trust you, can't change you <br>
        I just hope we don't end how they do <br>
        Crash and burn on The Shade Room <br>
        <br>
        <em>[Chorus]
        Street runner, gotta stop running sometimes (Yeah) <br>
        I'm in your city tonight (Yeah) <br>
        And these lights (These lights), make me feel so inspired (Yeah) <br>
        Going higher and higher and higher (Yeah, yeah) <br>
        Taking me higher (Taking me higher) <br>
        Higher and higher and higher (Yeah, yeah) <br></em>
        <br>
        [Outro]
        Hey, I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up <br>
        I kinda just called to hear your voice, so <br>
        Your voice recording was enough <br>
        Ugh, I should hang up, what am I doing? Um <br>
        So uh, I feel kinda dumb, but uh <br>
        I miss you, I've been thinking about you <br>
        I've been thinking about our love and how much I miss your touch <br>
        I miss being around you, hearing your laugh and holding your hand <br>
        I think of you every day <br>
        I hope and I wish that you're doing okay <br>
        I want us to go back to the old days <br>
        Because, I miss you, and I just thought of you, so I thought I'd call you <br>
        To tell you that you cross my mind and I took that as a sign, that I should call and say hi <br>
        So that's all, hi <br>
        I hope you don't think I've lost my mind, I hope you don't think I'm crazy <br>
        This message is getting long so I just say bye, but <br>
        The idea of you listening to this, the thought of you <br>
        I can't hang up <br>
        I'm in your city tonight <br>
        And these lights make me feel so inspired <br>
        Going higher and higher and higher <br></p>
        <br>
